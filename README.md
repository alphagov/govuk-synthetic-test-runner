# GOV.UK Synthetic test app

This is a synthetic test app used to run Ginkgo tests to test aspects of the GOV.UK infrastructure.

## Deploying the tests on EKS

To deploy the tests you will need to merge in your changes to the `main` branch and then update the image tag in the [govuk-helm-charts repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/govuk-synthetic-test-runner/values.yaml#L2) to the latest release.

## Running Ginkgo tests locally

NOTE - at the moment the tests only work when deployed on to an EKS cluster as it is using the synthetic-test-assumer role.

The image tag in the manifest is the most recent build generated by a merge into main or a manual trigger of the [build-runner](.github/workflows/build-runner.yaml) workflow in [github actions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-synthetic-test-runner/actions). You can set it to latest to always use the latest build or target a specific release from the list of [packages available](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-synthetic-test-runner/pkgs/container/govuk%2Fgovuk-synthetic-test-runner-runner).

The following commands target integration, replace integration with staging / production to target those environments.

- Before running the tests please ensure that the correct kubectl context is set, eg

`kubectl config use-context govuk-integration`

- To get the tests running you will need to apply this manifest

`gds aws govuk-integration-platformengineer -- kubectl apply -f ./govuk-synthetic-test-runner.yaml -n apps`

- To see the results of the tests you can run this kubectl command

`gds aws govuk-integration-platformengineer -- kubectl logs govuk-synthetic-test-runner -n apps`

- To delete the pod after the tests have completed run this kubectl command

`gds aws govuk-integration-platformengineer -- kubectl delete -f ./govuk-synthetic-test-runner.yaml -n apps`
